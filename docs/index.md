# Welcome to GIS4WRF

Here you can find installation instructions, documentation and tutorials for the [GIS4WRF plug-in](https://github.com/GIS4WRF/gis4wrf) ([@Meyer and Riechert 2018a]; [@Meyer and Riechert 2018b]).

GIS4WRF is a free and open source QGIS plug-in to help researchers and practitioners with their [Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) ([@Skamarock et al. 2008]) modelling workflows. GIS4WRF can be used to pre-process input data, run simulations and visualize or post-process results on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

!!! info "Pre-built binaries with WRF-CMake"
    Did you know that we provide pre-built binaries for Windows, macOS and Linux through [WRF-CMake](https://github.com/WRF-CMake) ([@Riechert and Meyer 2018])? To know how to download and use them in GIS4WRF see the [Documentation](documentation) section. If you are looking to download the pre-built WPS/WRF programs separately go to [https://github.com/WRF-CMake](https://github.com/WRF-CMake).

!!! warning "Upgrade WPS and WRF pre-built binaries to v4"
    If you had previously downloaded our pre-built binaries, please make sure to upgrade to the latest version (v4). For more information, see [here](configuration/#integration-with-wpswrf).
