# Welcome to GIS4WRF

Here you can find installation instructions, documentation and tutorials for the [GIS4WRF plug-in](https://github.com/GIS4WRF/gis4wrf) ([@Meyer and Riechert 2019]; [@Meyer and Riechert 2018]).

GIS4WRF is a free and open source QGIS plug-in to help researchers and practitioners with their [Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model) ([@Skamarock et al. 2008]) modelling workflows. GIS4WRF can be used to pre-process input data, run simulations and visualize or post-process results on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

!!! info "Pre-built binaries with WRF-CMake"
    Did you know that we provide pre-built binaries for Windows, macOS and Linux through [WRF-CMake](https://github.com/WRF-CMake)? To know how to download and use them in GIS4WRF see the [Documentation](documentation) section. If you are looking to download the pre-built WPS/WRF programs separately go to [https://github.com/WRF-CMake](https://github.com/WRF-CMake).

On macOS and Linux, or if you are new to QGIS or GIS4WRF, please see the [installation page](../installation). If you want to know how to download pre-built binaries for WPS and WRF so that you can run simulations on Windows, macOS and Linux, see the [Configuration](../configuration) section. To learn how to use GIS4WRF see the [Documentation](../documentation) or [Tutorials](../tutorials) sections.
