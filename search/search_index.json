Using Creative Commons Public Licenses Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses. Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are intended for use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it. Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license. This includes other CC- licensed material, or material used under an exception or limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors Considerations for the public: By using one of our public licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons, including because others have copyright or other rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations for the public: wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees ======================================================================= Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License (\"Public License\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions. Section 1 -- Definitions. a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image. b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License. c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights. d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements. e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material. f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License. g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license. h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License. i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them. j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world. k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning. Section 2 -- Scope. a. License grant. 1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to: a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material. 2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions. 3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a). 4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a) (4) never produces Adapted Material. 5. Downstream recipients. a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License. b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material. 6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i). b. Other rights. 1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise. 2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License. 3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties. Section 3 -- License Conditions. Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions. a. Attribution. 1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must: a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material: i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated); ii. a copyright notice; iii. a notice that refers to this Public License; iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties; v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable; b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License. 2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information. 3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable. 4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License. Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights. Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material: a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database; b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights. Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability. a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability. Section 6 -- Term and Termination. a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically. b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates: 1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or 2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License. c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License. d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License. Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions. a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed. b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License. Section 8 -- Interpretation. a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License. b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions. c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor. d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority. ======================================================================= Creative Commons is not a party to its public licenses.

In this example tutorial we show how to use GIS4WRF to easily and quickly download data, configure WPS and WRF namelists for a real case, and run a WRF simulation on your local machine using the pre-built binaries provided . We simulate 6 hours, for an area centered in Amsterdam, for the 15 July 2018 (12:00 - 18:00) related to the heat wave that affected the Netherlands between the 15 and 27 July 2018 . You should be able to complete this tutorial in less than 20 minutes, including simulation. On an average machine, dual core @ 2.4 GHz with 8 GB of RAM, this 6-hour simulation should take no more than 5 minutes to complete. Checklist before you begin You have followed our instructions to install and configure GIS4WRF. You have enabled the integration with WPS/WRF and downloaded the latest pre-built binaries. If you are running using MPI-enabled binaries, make sure that the number of MPI processes does not exceed 6 . You have enabled the integration with NCAR's Research Data Archive . Overview \u00b6 The whole process from configuration to running the simulation and visualization of outputs will take no more than 20 minutes on an average machine. This process can be broken down in the following six steps: Create project Define domain Download input data Select input data Configure and run View results Create project \u00b6 From QGIS launch GIS4WRF from the Plugins > GIS4WRF menu. Create a new GIS4WRF project by going to Simulation > General and clicking on Create a GIS4WRF Project (1). A new window will appear. Create a new folder named 2018_07_15_Amsterdam (2) and click on Select Folder (3). Note that after a project is created, the Project Path will point to the project folder. Never lose your configuration settings! Any settings are automatically saved by GIS4WRF and stored in your project file. Define domain \u00b6 Navigate to Simulation > Domain and fill the sections as follows: GCS/Projection: Lambert Conformal True Latitude 1: 3.5 True Latitude 2: 7 Standard Longitude: 4 Click on Set Map CRS Horizontal Grid Spacing: 3000 Enable (tick) Advanced Configuration Center Point Longitude: 4.8952 Center Point Latitude: 52.3702 Grid Extent (Horizontal): 30 Grid Extent (Vertical): 30 Enable (tick) Parenting Child-to-Parent Ratio: 3 Padding (Top, Right, Bottom, Left): 10 You can view the domain layers individually by clicking and expanding the domain group (1) and focus on the region of study by right-clicking on the WRF Domains (Vector) group and Zoom to Group (2). Warning GIS4WRF defines domains from the inside out. This allows you to have full control on positioning the inner-most domain. Download input data \u00b6 Two datasets are needed to run WRF: Geographical data used by the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS), and Meteorological data used to create initial and boundary conditions. Download of geographical data and meteorological data can be carried out in parallel -- i.e. you can start downloading meteorological data even if the geographical data has not finished downloading. However, you must wait until both meteorological and geographical data have been fully downloaded before proceeding to the Select input data section . Info We choose to download datasets after defining the domain so that its coordinates can be used to subset our request, thus reducing the amount of data to download. Geographical data \u00b6 Navigate to Dataset > Geo . Click on Select Mandatory Fields in Lowest Resolution and Download Selected Datasets . Once the download is complete go to meteorological data . Info Depending on your internet connection, the download can take a few minutes. Meteorological data \u00b6 To download the meteorological data navigate to Dataset > Met and select: Dataset: ds083.3 Product: Analysis Start: 15/07/2018 12:00 (for US datetime format: 7/15/18 12:00 PM ) End: 15/07/2018 18:00 (for US datetime format: 7/15/18 06:00 PM ) Under Extent click on subset, then select Domain 2 on the Layers panel (2) and click on Set from Active Layer (3) to subset your request. Finally, click Download to submit and download your request. Once the download is complete go to Select input data . Info Depending on your internet connection and the data request preparation on NCAR's Research Data Archive servers, the download can take a few minutes. Select input data \u00b6 GIS4WRF automatically pre-populates WPS and WRF namelists based on your domain configuration and data selection. Go to Simulation > Data . As you already have downloaded geographical and meteorological data, simply type lowres in the Domain 1 and Domain 2 fields (1) and click on 2018-07-15 12:00 - 2018-07-15 18:00 (2) and Use Dataset Selection from List (3) to select the meteorological data. Configure and run \u00b6 There are two main processes involved in running a real-case simulation: configure and run the WRF Preprocessing System (WPS), and configure and run WRF. WPS \u00b6 WPS comprises of three programs: Geogrid, Ungrib, and Metgrid. As GIS4WRF pre-populates namelists for you, you can directly go to Simulation > Run and click on the Geogrid , Ungrib , and Metgrid buttons individually. At the end of each program you will receive the following prompt from Geogrid (1), Ungrib (2), and Metgrid (3). WRF \u00b6 There are two programs you will need to run: Real and WRF. GIS4WRF already pre-populates most of the namelist used by Real and WRF ( namelist.input ) for you, however it will not select physics and dynamics options for you by design \u2014 after all, this is meant to be science so you should know the options to choose. For this tutorial, however, I have pre-selected the options for you. Click on Open configuration (1) and replace all values in the configuration window (2) with the namelist.input file below (simply copy and paste) and click on Save (3). namelist.input &time_control start_year = 2018, 2018 start_month = 7, 7 start_day = 15, 15 start_hour = 12, 12 end_year = 2018, 2018 end_month = 7, 7 end_day = 15, 15 end_hour = 18, 18 interval_seconds = 21600 input_from_file = .true., .true. history_interval = 10, 10 frames_per_outfile = 100, 100 restart = .false. restart_interval = 7200 io_form_history = 2 io_form_restart = 2 io_form_input = 2 io_form_boundary = 2 start_minute = 0, 0 start_second = 0, 0 end_minute = 0, 0 end_second = 0, 0 nocolons = .true. / &domains time_step = 40 time_step_fract_num = 0 time_step_fract_den = 1 max_dom = 2 e_we = 31, 31 e_sn = 31, 31 e_vert = 33, 33 p_top_requested = 5000 num_metgrid_levels = 32 num_metgrid_soil_levels = 4 dx = 9000.0, 3000.0 dy = 9000.0, 3000.0 grid_id = 1, 2 parent_id = 1, 1 i_parent_start = 1, 11 j_parent_start = 1, 11 parent_grid_ratio = 1, 3 parent_time_step_ratio = 1, 3 feedback = 1 smooth_option = 0 / &physics physics_suite = 'CONUS' mp_physics = 0, 0 cu_physics = 0, 0 radt = 9, 3 bldt = 0, 0 cudt = 0, 0 icloud = 0 num_land_cat = 21 sf_urban_physics = 1, 1 / &dynamics hybrid_opt = 2 w_damping = 0 diff_opt = 1, 1 km_opt = 4, 4 diff_6th_opt = 0, 0, 0 diff_6th_factor = 0.12, 0.12 base_temp = 290.0 damp_opt = 3 zdamp = 5000.0, 5000.0 dampcoef = 0.2, 0.2 khdif = 0, 0 kvdif = 0, 0 / &bdy_control spec_bdy_width = 5 specified = .true. / &namelist_quilt / Now you are good to go, run Real and WRF (1). At the end of each program you will receive the following prompt from Real (2) and WRF (3). View results \u00b6 After the simulation is complete, click Visualize Output (1), select the file wrfout_d01_2018-07-15_12_00_00 (2) and click Open . Images are displayed geo-referenced on the map canvas.

Configure and run WPS \u00b6 The WRF Preprocessing System (WPS) is used to generate inputs to the WRF program real.exe . WPS consists of three main programs ( geogrid.exe , ungrib.exe , and metgrid.exe ) and other utilities programs that may be used to configure specific cases. A configuration file named namelist.wps is used to set options for all the WPS programs. For this simple case study, go to your WPS installation folder and create/replace the content of namelist.wps with the following configuration replacing <ABS_PATH_TO_GEOG_DIR> with the absolute path to the geographical data directory: namelist.wps &share nocolons = .true. max_dom = 2 start_date = '2018-07-15_12:00:00', '2018-07-15_12:00:00' end_date = '2018-07-15_18:00:00', '2018-07-15_18:00:00' interval_seconds = 21600 / &geogrid parent_id = 1, 1 parent_grid_ratio = 1, 3 i_parent_start = 1, 11 j_parent_start = 1, 11 e_we = 31, 31 e_sn = 31, 31 map_proj = 'lambert' dx = 9000.0 dy = 9000.0 ref_lon = 4.8952 ref_lat = 52.370199999992614 geog_data_res = 'lowres', 'lowres' geog_data_path = '<ABS_PATH_TO_GEOG_DIR>' truelat1 = 3.5 truelat2 = 7.0 stand_lon = 4.0 / &metgrid fg_name = 'FILE' / Run Geogrid \u00b6 From the WPS installation directory, run geogrid.exe to produce geo_em files. Run Ungrib \u00b6 Before you can run ungrib.exe , you need to copy a Vtable -- in this case the Vtable.GFS file -- from ungrib/Variable_Tables to your WPS installation directory.
